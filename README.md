### Problem Statement
In GitHub, README.md is the file shown on a repositoryâ€™s home page containing information about the project, license, author, organization etc. The markdown is not obvious and can be time consuming to format manually. Also, since GitHub does not load custom stylesheets, displaying an image of custom size is quite tedious.
In addition, large organizations may require a common README template with a universal header, footer and license across all their projects.

### Proposed Solution
A WYSIWYG editor for README.md file with options to select available GitHub supported markdowns, embed images, links. Also the capability to create templates that can be reused across multiple projects.
Ability to directly push to Git.
For large organizations, the ability to impose a common template and license across all their projects.
